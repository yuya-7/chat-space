  Some doc and warning fixes for newer Rubies.

  We're no longer on bogomips.org since it's due
  for expiry and I can't pay extortionists for a .org, so
  s/bogomips.org/yhbt.net/ for now, and be prepared to move again
  when extortionists move onto the .net TLD.

        pkg.mk: use --local to "gem install"
        pkg.mk: use dark216 theme for Earth Day 2019
        test: fix warnings with RUBYOPT=-w
        tests: fix unused variable warnings from newer Rubies
        test_connect_fd_leak: do not close socket if non-existent
        test_syssend: avoid warning on cleanup
        build: remove olddoc from the gemspec
        doc: remove private email and outdated gmane archives
        doc: move from bogomips.org/kgio to yhbt.net/kgio
