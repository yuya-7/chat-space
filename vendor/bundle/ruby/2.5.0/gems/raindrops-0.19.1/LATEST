=== raindrops 0.19.1 / 2020-01-08 09:31 UTC

  This release fixes some warnings on newer Rubies.

  We're no longer on bogomips.org since it's due
  for expiry and I can't pay extortionists for a .org, so
  s/bogomips.org/yhbt.net/ for now, and be prepared to move again
  when extortionists move onto extorting the .net TLD.

        doc: switch homepage to dark216
        ext/raindrops/extconf: fix cflags reset on ancient CC
